        <h2>Exploring Food Conservation Methods</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container-box">
        
        <h4>Food conservation practices aim to minimize the quantity of food disposed of by households and businesses. These methods typically involve strategies such as composting, recycling, and anaerobic digestion. Moreover, food conservation endeavors often include educational campaigns to increase awareness about the environmental repercussions of food wastage. Such initiatives may also necessitate infrastructural enhancements, such as the introduction of efficient collection systems for segregating and properly managing food wastage. On a daily basis, food establishments discard substantial amounts of high-quality, delectable food. This may include batches of fresh produce that don't meet aesthetic standards, or surplus milk ordered for school cafeterias. Consequently, food that could nourish people instead ends up in landfills. In India, grand-scale events like weddings often result in significant food wastage. Nevertheless, restaurants and hotels also contribute to this issue. Nearly 14% of the global food supply is lost between harvest and retail stages. India alone contributes approximately 68.8 million tons of wasted food annually, which constitutes 7% of the global total, according to the United Nations Environment Programme's Food Waste Index Report 2021. <br> <br>
        This is where <span>EcoBite</span> comes into play. Our initiative strives to minimize food wastage and combat hunger through responsible consumption and production. We operate across various regions and collaborate with events and venues to collect surplus food and redistribute it to those in need. <br> <br>
